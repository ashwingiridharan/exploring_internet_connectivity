A study on understanding internet connectivity in developing regions. We concentrated on the South American continent. Our datasources are CAIDA, telize, iPlane and MaxMind. We analyzed around 300,000 traceroutes to identify circuitous paths and compare the region's AS relationships. We abstracted the problem by visualizing router level and AS level connectivity.

Visualization tools:
1. Otter - http://www.caida.org/tools/visualization/otter/

2. Walrus - http://www.caida.org/tools/visualization/walrus/

3. Circos - http://circos.ca/

4. Google Maps API

This project was motivated by the study by Gupta, Arpit, et al on ”Peering at the Internets frontier: A first look at ISP interconnectivity in Africa.” Passive and Active Measurement. Springer International Publishing, 2014.
